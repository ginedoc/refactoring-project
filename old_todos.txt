Fix stereo to work if amp goes into score module or something else.

* Consider whitney time fix - move 360 degrees into future after 180 point.

* Fix Graphics Display
  * Playback is broken.
  
* Fix graphics & mem-storage to work with stereo
   * Add stereo reverb and stereo filtering
   * To save processing, track if we're in stereo via patchowner.

* Work on Jon's stuff - check into possibility of using cswf for
  generating slide shows...

* Consider module for storing editable curves (spline-like which go from 0-1).
* Referenced as ctab(0,t) - useful for additive synthesis.

* Also consider module for sequencer values (stab(n,t))

* Add version numbers for Syd - display it at startup.

* Debug filetab problem - try to simplify bug reproduction.
  
* Continue looking for interesting free audio software.
  * Look for new popular free audio projects (in linux community?)
  * Look for interesting vsts.
  * Play with KRISTAL.

* Work on methods for storing tables of arbitrary values (Sequencer Module).
  Function with var arg list?
  
  seq(i,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8)
  
* Analyse use of reset in patch activation, see why
  SSPluck got initialized incorrectly.

   KP appears to be pulling parameters from outer-nested score module.  Why?
   (callingMod appears to be incorrect...)

   (Seems to happen from initial cloning of note in outer score - needlessly calls pluck-reset)
    Consider fixing reset for nested scores...   

* Continue testing patches
  * problem with sound playback after time (window activiation?)

* Consider making an applet version which synthesizes to memory only,
and can load patches.

* Force patches to output to patchfile name + .wav/.aiff etc.

* Work on slow renders - see if we can get graphing working.

* Finish functions
	CalcMandel, CalcMandelCPM, CalcMandel3,CalcJulia, CalcDragon, fBm, gnoise, GTurbulence3D, 

* Finish toolbar functions.
	Add Toolbar/Menus
		File: new,open,save,saveas
		Synth: Synthesize, Play, AbortSynth (or Stopplay)
		Options: ListenDuringSynth, ShowGraph
		Help: HelpTopics/AboutSyd

* Test on Mac.

* Research stand-alone app distribution for PC & Mac.

* Work on HELP.

* Add CSound Override.

* Add support stereo panning (using amplifier?)
   * Add stereo checkbox to output

* Dig up, and reproduce some classic star-trek and videogame effects.

(low) Reorganize units in better order.

(low) When closing a patch, stop playback.

(low) - get better synthesize and play icons

(low) Hide tools when windows are deactivated

(low) Finish rectangle group selection.
  * Add support for ctrl key.

(low) Continue working on file-save/file-open dialogs.  Don't use full-path name if it corresponds
to current patch directory for window.

(low) Consider adding labels for column headers in ParamDefs.

(low) * Consider adding new icon type for abstract parameter units (ftab, p, g, folder input)

(low) * Make tests for SSMaraca, SSGAssign, SSSampleFile.

* * *

Three independent compondents.

1) Front end - for building patches.  Can output patch as Syd Patch data, or XML data.

Consider using XML data for describing the modules available, what their parameters are,
and how do edit & output them.  This will allow module definitions to be changed to work
with future versions of CSyd.

2) Sound Renderer - gets input patch as Syd Patch data or XML data.
  2a) Local Sound Renderer
  2b) Command-line Sound Renderer (works with CSyd) - compare timings with Local
  2c) Network Sound Renderer

3) Graphical sound display / preview - gets input from sound renderer.
Presents waveform preview/zooming and has playback button.
