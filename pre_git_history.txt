JSyd
4/1/11
  Fixed error in Pluck when frequencies are < 0 or > 20000 (causing gaps in output)
  (note to build, use 'ant dist')

5/07/09
  Added stereo + panning support to CSyd (it hadn't been added earlier).
  Attempting to debug random noise glitches which show up in complex patches rendered on Mac.
  Noise issues aren't happening on CSyd.
    
2/12/07 (forensic note)
  Updates to SSModule, SydPanel, ModList, JSydApp
  * Use Smaller Module Size
  * Turn off Auto-connect as default.
  (both for Dan Landes)
  
8/13/06 (forensic note)
  Bug fixes (quite possibly related to stereo) in SSOutput, SSStorage, SSStoreMem, GraphCanvas
  NOTE: Check if these changes are in CSyd...
  
8/11 (forensic)
  Made some updates to CSyd modules: ssadsr.h, ssadsr.cpp, ssoutput.cpp, ssmodule.cpp, ssmain.cpp

8/7/06 (last note from laptop - next couple are forensic)

Added stereo support - amplifier module can do panning.

8/2/06 (forensic)

7/12/06
Patching interface (with zap linking feature) is basically working.
Tested on linux.
Beginning work on parameter editing / patch saving.

6/14/06 Got basic expressions working (most functions unimplemented)
60 second sine wave 5.04 5.10 5.0

6/12/06 Got a minimal patch with no formulas to render.  60 second sine wave: 7.532 seconds
(compared to 0.48 for CSyd)
repeated runs:
7.53 6.54 5.67 5.7
eliminate calls to System.currentTimeMillis
5.54 5.58 5.71
